# Prowl-Patrol-s-Web-Chatting-Application
The idea behind the website is to create a real time updated chatting application using AJAX . 
The web-application is created to help users connect to their family and friends securely. 
To access the chatting application the user have to login first .  
The chatting area is updated real-time  using the AJAX technology. 

More about AJAX: 
• Read data from a web server - after a web page has loaded 
• Update a web page without reloading the page 
• Send data to a web server - in the background 
  AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes. 
  This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.
